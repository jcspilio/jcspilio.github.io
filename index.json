Originally concerned with gambling, it has since become part of the standard toolkit of social scientists, biologists, psychologists, political scientists -- even historians and philosophers! This course is an introduction to the methods and applications of game theory. It is designed to stimulate careful thinking about the use (and potential abuse) of mathematics as an instrument for the formal study of strategic behaviour. It also provides empirical evidence on these interactions.\n I. Pure game theory 1. Fundamentals of game theory  Solution concepts (Lecture 1, Lecture 2) Bayesian games (Lecture 4) Global games (Lecture 5) Voting games (Lecture 6) Behavioral game theory (Lecture 3)  Assignments Week 2: Problem set 1, problems 1, 2 and 3; problem set 2, problem 1.\nWeek 3: Problem set 2, problems 2 and 3; problem set 3, problem 2.\nSuggested readings  MO chapters 2 (Nash equilibrium), 4 (mixed-strategy equilibrium), 9 (Bayesian games) and 12 (rationalizability).

On the one hand, by describing and conceptualizing how human decisions depart from rationality, behaviourists place themselves at the forefront of the critique of neoclassical economics. On the other hand, behavioural economics remain largely indebted to rational decision theorists, who long before sought to improve the realism of their models. This course therefore begins with an overview of neoclassical decision theory, including empirical applications and measurement. This allows to explore its legacy and its points of clash with modern behavioural economics and economic psychology.\n 1. Neoclassical decision theory: risk and time preferences  Varian, H. R. 2009.
